To craft Vibranium tools, weapons, and armor, you will need the **Vibranium Upgrade**, a special template found in **Trial Chambers**. This template is essential for enhancing your equipment and unlocking the full potential of Vibranium.

Equip yourself with Vibranium Tools, including the essential sword, pickaxe, axe, shovel, and hoe, designed to withstand the toughest challenges. For defense, craft the unique **Vibranium Shield** to bolster your protection in battle. For those who seek efficiency, the **Vibranium Mace** allows you to mine in a 3x3 area, making resource gathering faster and more enjoyable.

But the Vibranium Mod offers more than just tools. Deep beneath the earth, you may encounter the mysterious Vibra Golem. This powerful entity can be tamed and will loyally follow and protect you on your adventures, adding an exciting new dimension to your underground explorations.

Immerse yourself in the world of Vibranium and discover how this extraordinary material can change the way you play Minecraft. Whether you're a builder, an explorer, or a fighter, the Vibranium Mod offers something for everyone.
